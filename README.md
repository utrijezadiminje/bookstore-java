# bookstore-java
A bookstore GUI app made using **swing** for the GUI and **mssql-jdbc** for connecting with the database.
#

All ***Frame.java** classes represent a `java.swing.JFrame` module.

Special focus on the **DBconnect.java** class, as it has several functions that connect the application to a database on a remote server.
